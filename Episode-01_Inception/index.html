<!--
The order of the script files are always in sequence.
We should always keep the react cdn link before the App.js script file.

The correct order of files is:

<script
    crossorigin
    src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js">
</script>
<script
    crossorigin
    src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js">

<script src="App.js"></script>

======================================================================

root.render(parent) is putting the parent inside the root element.
Suppose, if something is already present inside the root element, and I am trying to render parent over here.

root.render(parent) will replace whatever is present inside the root element with the parent.

================================================================================================================

Suppose, I have something above and below the root element. Will they get replaced too ?

Whatever is present above/below the root element, will remain unchanged.
Because, react is working only inside the root element.
Everything that we render will render inside the root.

This is why we call react as a library also.
Because, React can be applied to a small portion of the webpage itself.
React can only work in header or only in footer or only in sidebar also.
React only works in the place whatever you make the root as.
